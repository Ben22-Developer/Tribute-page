        He started engaging in politics and he helped the formation of the 
        <strong><abbr title="African National Congress">ANC</abbr></strong> Youth League,
        which was a political group that strived for equal rights for whites and blacks in South Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
        Within the same year he also married his first wife <ins>Evelyn Rakeepile</ins>.
    </p>
    <p> 
        In <strong>1948</strong> the South African government introduced a system called <strong>apartheid</strong>,
        which furthered the country's racial divide even more. 
        Under new racist laws, black people and white people were forced to live separate lives.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an influencial leader of <strong><abbr title="African National Congress">ANC</abbr> </strong> Nelson Mandela continued to
        fight against <strong>apartheid</strong> by trying to make negotiations with the racist government but finally ignored,as 
        ANC had a military group called <strong>Umkhonto we Sizwe</strong> which fought for anti-racism.
        This military was discovered by the government and Nelson Mandela with his collegues were all
        arrested in <strong>1962</strong> a life sentence.

    <li>1990-2013</li>
        <p>
            Over time, Nelson Mandela became a famous prisoner, and there were calls all around the world to <strong>Free Nelson Mandela!</strong>.<br>
            Finally in <strong>1990</strong> the president of South Africa, FW de Klerk, met with Nelson Mandela and in February/11/1990 and set him free!
            This was done after the 9 days of unbannig of <abbr title="African National Congress">ANC</abbr> and <abbr title="Pan African Congress">PAC</abbr>.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>   
        <p>
            In <strong>1999</strong> he retired as a president,but he was still a figure around the world as a symbol of <strong>peace and equality</strong>.<br>
            For the rest of his life Nelson Mandela was a living hero of the African people because of his persistant strong heart, <strong>tolerance</strong>, 
            do or die actions and in additional he was a man of his word.<br>
            Unfortunetly he died on <strong>5th/December/2013</strong> having <strong>95 years old </strong>because of the lung infections.
